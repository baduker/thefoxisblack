The Fox is Black is a fanstastic (yet, apparently dead) blog full of fabulous images. However, there's no way to download an entire bundle of images, hence this simple scraper.

By the way, the entire dump can be found [here](https://yadi.sk/d/QeoElPTiUFX7sA). (Only dekstop images of 1280x900 - 1900x1200)
